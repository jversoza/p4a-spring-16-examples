how complex do i have to make my project?

*not* grading on complexity
* make it as challenging
* or as "easy" as you want

*not* on aesthetics
or ux or any of that


3 x classes or decorators

* does your class or decorator actually do something 
* or does it just do this

class Foo:
    pass

class MySuperError(Exception):
    pass
 
* at least have some methods
* and data fields
* relevant to project

2 x list comprehensions or map/filter/(maybe even reduce)

3pts of modules
use the features in the module

* flask
    * a static site
* socket server
    * you can base off of examples
    * but don't just copy the actual class examples
* use csv
* use sqlite(research)
* use pil

use your "other" module to create "assets" for your project

* if you're making a game... maybe you could use pyaudio to create sound effects (write sound files)
* interactive story with flask
    * use csv to store data


* how do milestones (#0 ... proposal, #1 ... which is start on project) count?
    * they count as part of your final project grade
    * maybe ~ 10 points each
    * 60 ~ 80
