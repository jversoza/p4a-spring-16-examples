* grading for milestone #1
    * um?
    * class vs dict / should I use a class?
        * refactor to include useful method
    * minimal flask code
    * still received majority of credit for both of above 

Final Exam
-----

* first exam, 8am :( 
* I'll have cleaned up notes up by this evening
* we can do more than one review
    * let me know what you want me to review on Wednesday

Final Project
-----

* put attributions in code (even if it's off of hw or slides)
    * majority of code should be _your own_
    * academic integrity
* 3 classes... again, not just pass
    * also not just data 
    * (otherwise it could just be a dictionary)
* add a requirements.txt
    * run this in project directory... aaand
    * create a new file called `requirements.txt`

```
import os
import sys
from subprocess import call
cmd = os.path.join(sys.prefix, 'bin', 'pip')
print("1. Create a file called requirements.txt: File -> New... -> File")
print("2. Copy the output between the lines (---'s) below into the file")
print('-' * 20)
call([cmd, "freeze"])
print('-' * 20)
print('Copy the output above between the lines (---\'s) into a new file called requirements.txt')
```

* form will be posted to submit:
    * modules used
    * location and name of classes / decorators and purpose
    * location of list comprehension
    * what would go in readme (how to run)... including usernames, etc.
    * list tutorials or existing projects that code is based off of (more than a couple of lines)
        * again, majority of your code should be your own
        * fine to base stuff off of homework or in class examples
        * but make sure code is not just a repeat of a single assignment or example
    * "happy path" ... direct me on how to use your applications

Optional Assignment
-----

* use for review
* dice game
